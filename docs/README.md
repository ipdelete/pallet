## üîë Key Concepts

### Agent
A service that exposes skills via HTTP endpoints following the A2A protocol.

### Skill
A discrete capability that an agent provides (e.g., `translate_text`, `analyze_image`).

### Agent Card
JSON document describing an agent's capabilities and how to interact with it.

### Registry
OCI-compliant storage for agent cards enabling dynamic discovery.

### Orchestrator
Component that coordinates multiple agents to achieve complex goals.

### Discovery
Process of finding agents based on required skills rather than hardcoded URLs.

## üíª Technology Stack

The implementation uses:
- **Python 3.11+** - Primary implementation language
- **FastAPI** - Web framework for agents
- **JSON-RPC 2.0** - Communication protocol
- **OCI Registry** - Agent card storage
- **ORAS** - Registry interaction tool
- **Docker** - Containerization

## üöÄ Quick Example

Here's the simplest possible agent:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/agent-card")
async def agent_card():
    return {
        "name": "hello-agent",
        "url": "http://localhost:8000",
        "skills": [{
            "id": "say_hello",
            "description": "Says hello",
            "input_schema": {"type": "object"},
            "output_schema": {"type": "object"}
        }]
    }

@app.post("/execute")
async def execute(request: dict):
    if request["method"] == "say_hello":
        return {"jsonrpc": "2.0", "result": {"message": "Hello!"}, "id": request["id"]}
```

## üí° Design Philosophy

The A2A pattern follows these principles:

1. **Simplicity** - Agents should be simple and focused
2. **Interoperability** - Any agent can work with any other agent
3. **Discoverability** - Find agents by capability, not location
4. **Composability** - Build complex behaviors from simple agents
5. **Resilience** - Handle failures gracefully

## ü§ù Contributing

When extending this pattern:

1. Keep agents stateless when possible
2. Use standard schemas for common data types
3. Version everything (agents, skills, workflows)
4. Document skill inputs and outputs clearly
5. Provide examples in skill definitions

## üìù Notes on the Pallet Implementation

The Pallet framework (in this repository) demonstrates the A2A pattern with three example agents:

- **Plan Agent** - Converts requirements to structured plans
- **Build Agent** - Generates code from plans
- **Test Agent** - Reviews and validates code

These are just examples. The pattern itself is completely domain-agnostic and can be used for any type of agent system.

## üéì Learning Path

### Beginner
1. Read Quick Reference - 5-minute quick start
2. Run the example agent
3. Modify it to add a new skill

### Intermediate
1. Read the Agent Development Guide
2. Build a multi-skill agent
3. Set up a local registry
4. Implement discovery

### Advanced
1. Study Orchestration Patterns
2. Build complex workflows
3. Implement production features (monitoring, caching, etc.)
4. Deploy multi-agent system

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

Potential areas for extension:

- WebSocket support for streaming
- GraphQL interface option
- Agent mesh networking
- Federated learning integration
- Blockchain-based agent registry
- Natural language skill discovery

**Remember**: The power of A2A comes from composition. Start with simple agents that do one thing well, then orchestrate them into powerful systems that solve complex problems.
